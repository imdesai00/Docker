- Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to manage complex applications consisting of multiple services, networks, and volumes using a single YAML configuration file (**`docker-compose.yml`**).
- The **`docker-compose.yml`** file specifies the services (containers), networks, volumes, environment variables, and other configurations required for the application.
- Docker Compose simplifies the process of orchestrating multiple containers and their dependencies, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy application

- **Description**: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file (**`docker-compose.yml`**) to specify services, networks, and volumes.
- **Example**: Below is an example **`docker-compose.yml`** file for a simple web application with a Node.js backend and a MongoDB database
    
    ```bash
    version: '3'
    services:
      web:
        build: .
        ports:
          - '3000:3000'
        depends_on:
          - db
      db:
        image: mongo:latest
    ```
    
- **Code**: To start the services defined in the **`docker-compose.yml`** file, run the following command
    
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```
    
1. **Services**:
    - Services are the building blocks of your application. Each service represents a container that performs a specific function, such as a web server, a database, or an application server.
    - Services are defined in the **`docker-compose.yml`** file along with their configurations, such as the Docker image to use, environment variables, ports to expose, volumes to mount, and dependencies on other services.
2. **Containers**:
    - Docker Compose uses Docker under the hood to create and manage containers based on the definitions in the **`docker-compose.yml`** file.
    - Each service definition in the **`docker-compose.yml`** file corresponds to a container when the application is started.
3. **Volumes**:
    - Volumes are used to persist data generated by containers or to share data between containers.
    - In Docker Compose, volumes can be defined in the **`docker-compose.yml`** file and mounted into containers, ensuring that data is retained even if the containers are destroyed or recreated.
4. **Networks**:
    - Docker Compose automatically creates a default network for your application, allowing containers defined in the same **`docker-compose.yml`** file to communicate with each other using service names as hostnames.
    - Additional custom networks can be defined in the **`docker-compose.yml`** file to isolate specific groups of services or to connect containers across multiple **`docker-compose.yml`** files or projects.
5. **`docker-compose.yml` file**:
    - This YAML-formatted file is the heart of Docker Compose. It contains all the necessary configurations for your multi-container application.
    - In addition to defining services, networks, and volumes, the **`docker-compose.yml`** file can also specify environment variables, container dependencies, and other options for managing the containers.
6. **Lifecycle management**:
    - Docker Compose provides simple commands for managing the lifecycle of your application, such as **`docker-compose up`** to start the application, **`docker-compose down`** to stop and remove the containers, and **`docker-compose restart`** to restart the containers.
    - It also supports scaling services by specifying the number of containers to run for each service.
