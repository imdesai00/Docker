# Docker 

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Docker provides a way to package and distribute applications in a consistent and portable manner across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.
